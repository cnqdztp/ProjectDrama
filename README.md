# ProjectDrama

ALL SOURCECODE IS LICENSED UNDER GNU General Public License v3.0 BUT ANY NON-SOFTWARE ASSETS IS PROHIBITED TO USE IN ANY CIRCUNSTANCES.

This game is made to participate in the Netease Minigame Contest, of which the subject is "Drama". We made a lot of efforts to recreate the 2.5D graphic, inspired by Octopath traveller.

There is no plan on updating this game in the future. All software-code is opensource while art asset's copyright is reserved by its creator.

See you next year.
